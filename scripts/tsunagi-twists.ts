/**
 * TSUNAGI'S TWISTS INTO THE LADDER, for `scripts/tsunagi-levels.ts`.
 *
 * John, 2026-09-26: "the ninth one has something simple of an obstacle and a
 * 10th one is much harder… little challenges per block", then sixteen to a
 * block. So the fifteenth and sixteenth levels of a block are its twist: the
 * 15th teaches it gently, the 16th tests it. Bridges come first, as he asked,
 * then walls (with blocked cells), waypoints and wrap; then each again in turn,
 * harder as the ladder climbs, bridges and walls tested together.
 *
 * EXPLOSIONS are the fifth lesson and every fifth after it. They change no
 * cell, so their lesson is the board already in the slot with an explosion
 * added (`explosive`): a boom that goes off about once on a clean solve at the
 * 15th, and at the 16th a blast (a boom every two strokes where there are too
 * few pairs for a blast to be fair). The other lessons keep the places they
 * had before explosions came, so adding them moved no other lesson.
 *
 * HEXAGONS are the seventh lesson and every fifth after it (the twelfth), at
 * the odd sizes only, the ones a hexagon of hexagons fits (`hexCandidate`):
 * whole new boards, the easy end of the kind's pool to teach and further up
 * it to test.
 *
 * A STROKE LIMIT is the sixth lesson and the fourteenth: like explosions it
 * changes no cell, so it is the slot's own board with a limit added — the
 * fewest strokes the board can be solved in and three to spare at the 15th,
 * the fewest exactly at the 16th. SPARSE BOARDS (few, long lines, `sparse.ts`)
 * are the eighth and the sixteenth, at 5×5 to 9×9: a 4×4 has too few cells for
 * a sparse board with one answer, and 10×10 and 11×11 too few blocks to reach.
 *
 * NEVER A BOARD WITH PLAY ON IT. A slot is only given a twist when its board
 * has none: the slots named in `keep` (read from production before the run:
 * solves, kept runs, attempts and races) keep their plain board, and so does
 * the rest of that block, because a lesson needs both its levels. A block that
 * already holds its planned lesson keeps it, so running this again moves
 * nothing. Levels 1 to 14 of every block are never touched.
