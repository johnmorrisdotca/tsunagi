/**
 * THE TSUNAGI LEVELS, MADE ON A DESK: `node scripts/tsunagi-levels.ts [size…] [--keep <size:level,…>] [--grow <size,…> [--migration <dir>]]`.
 *
 * For each size asked (all six when none is), fills grids with random lines
 * (`randomFilling`), keeps a layout only when the solver proves it has exactly
 * one answer, drops any that is the same board as one already kept under a
 * turn or a mirror, and writes the size's levels, easiest first, into
 * `src/levels/size<n>.data.ts`.
 *
 * Seeded, so the same run writes the same files: the data files are the
 * levels everybody plays, and this is how they were made, kept so they can be
 * made again. Nothing here runs on the site.
 *
 * EVERY BOARD ALREADY PLAYED IS KEPT. The levels in the size's file are read
 * first and all of them stay: somebody's solve, time or half-drawn board is
 * on each. New boards are added to them until the size has `WANTED`, in whole
 * blocks of `TSUNAGI_BLOCK` (16 blocks of 16, John: "16 levels of 16? Does
 * that equal 256?"), or as many whole blocks as the generator can make
 * distinct — 4×4 runs out at under two hundred. The new ones are taken evenly
 * along the pool sorted by solver effort, so they spread from easy to hard.
 *
 * EASY TO HARD. The whole set is then ordered by the measured difficulty
 * (`tsunagi/difficulty.ts`: corners, guessing, cells not forced, the longest
 * line), easiest first, so level 1 is the easiest board and each block of 16
 * harder than the one before; within a block the 15th and 16th are its two
 * hardest, the places a block's twist will take once twists exist.
 *
 * RENUMBERING. A level's number is its place, and places move when boards are
 * added or reordered. Kept runs, races and attempts are stored by number, so
 * every run that moves a board writes the move: `levels/renumbered.data.ts`
 * (old number to new, for a browser's own record of its solves) and, with
 * `--migration <dir>`, a migration that moves the stored rows with it. A
 * solve is kept by its board (`givens`), so it follows without being moved.
 *
 * A SIZE IS NEVER REORDERED UNLESS ASKED. A run keeps the order of the levels
 * it finds, so a board with play on it stays at its number; only `--grow` adds
 * boards (to whole blocks, up to `WANTED`) and reorders the size — only the
 * sizes it names, `--grow 10,11` — and a run that reorders a size with play on
 * it must ship with its migration. What a run may
 * still change is a block's 15th and 16th slot, given a twist where nobody has
 * played it (`tsunagi-twists.ts`, `--keep <size:level,…>` naming the slots
 * with play, read from production first), and the difficulty marks every level
 * shows (`levels/marks.data.ts`).
