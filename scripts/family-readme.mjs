// family-readme.mjs: writes the README's "The family" block from the one list of the family in
// family-template.mjs, so that every package's README says the same thing and none of them is typed by hand.
// Copied unchanged into each repository (scripts/family-readme.mjs); a package never edits it.
//
//   node scripts/family-readme.mjs           rewrite the block in README.md
//   node scripts/family-readme.mjs --check   exit 1, and say so, when README.md's block is not the written one
//
// The block sits between two markers, under the README's own "The family" heading:
//
//   <!-- family:start (…) -->  …  <!-- family:end -->
//
// Which package is reading is package.json's name, so each README says "is one of nineteen" about itself.
