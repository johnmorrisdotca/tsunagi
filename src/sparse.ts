/**
 * SPARSE BOARDS: the same size, fewer and longer lines. John, 2026-09-26: a
 * board harder without a new rule — "difficulty from distance". A board is
 * filled with lines as usual and proved to have one answer; then two lines
 * whose ends touch are joined into one, again and again, while the board keeps
 * exactly one answer, until no more than `sparseMost` are left. A joined line
 * never runs beside itself, so it is still one clean line.
 *
 * A sparse board says so (`sparse` after its cells), and a layout that says so
 * with more lines than `sparseMost` is not read at all: the word is a claim
 * about the board, checked, never a label that could be wrong.
 *
 * Imports carry their `.ts` so the level script can run this under plain node.
