/**
 * MAKING TSUNAGI'S TWISTS, on a desk: boards with bridges, and boards with
 * walls and blocked cells (John, 2026-09-26, both chosen from the brainstorm;
 * bridges first). Like `generate.ts`, only the level script calls this, and a
 * board is kept only when the solver proves it has exactly one answer — the one
 * it was made from.
 *
 * BRIDGES. A grid is filled with lines as for a plain board. Then, where a
 * line runs straight through a cell away from the edge and two other lines each
 * end on the cells either side of it the other way, those two are joined into
 * one line over the cell, which becomes a bridge: the first line goes over it
 * one way, the joined one the other. Repeated for as many bridges as asked,
 * never two side by side.
 *
 * WALLS AND BLOCKED CELLS. A few cells are blocked before the grid is filled,
 * so the lines go round them. Where the board then has more than one answer,
 * walls are put on edges between two different lines — never across an edge
 * the answer uses, so its answer stands — until it has one, and then every
 * wall that is not needed for that is taken away again. What is left is walls
 * a player has to use to find the answer.
