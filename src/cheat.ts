/**
 * CHEAT: one unfinished line drawn for the player, correctly. John,
 * 2026-09-26: beyond Check, which only flashes the unjoined pairs, "a Cheat
 * button that draws one unfinished line correctly", offered only where
 * "Allow cheating" was chosen at set-up. Flow Free's hint does the same — it
 * draws one whole flow.
 *
 * The line is the lowest-numbered pair not yet joined; where every pair is
 * joined but the board is wrong, the lowest whose line is not the answer's.
 * It is drawn as the answer has it, and any other line in its way is cut back
 * to before the first cell it would share — on a bridge only where both go the
 * same way over it, since two lines may cross there. Null when there is nothing
 * to draw: every line already the answer's. Pure: new lines, the old untouched.
