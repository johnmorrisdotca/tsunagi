/**
 * MAKING TSUNAGI LEVELS: the way John described it on 2026-09-26 — fill
 * the grid with lines that never cross, keep each line's two ends as its
 * stones, rub the lines out, and keep only the layouts the solver proves have
 * exactly one answer.
 *
 * Only `scripts/tsunagi-levels.ts` calls this, on a desk. The levels it
 * makes are curated into the size files (`levels/size<n>.data.ts`) and those
 * are what the site plays; nothing a reader does ever runs it.
 *
 * Every line it draws is at least three cells long (two stones side by side
 * are a line with nothing to think about) and never runs beside itself, so
 * each answer reads as clean lines and the solver's "exactly one" is rarely
 * spoiled by a line that could shortcut through its own bend.
