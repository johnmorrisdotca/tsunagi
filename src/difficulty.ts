/**
 * HOW HARD A TSUNAGI LEVEL IS, MEASURED. John, 2026-09-26, on 4×4 level 10 —
 * two straight rows and two empty pairs: "literally the easiest map we have…
 * it cannot be number 10, that would have to be number one". The levels were
 * ordered by solver effort alone, which a person does not feel: a board the
 * solver settles in a few positions can still wind, and one it must search
 * can be all straight lines.
 *
 * So a level is measured four ways, each a thing a person meets:
 *
 *  - CORNERS (35%): the turns in the answer's lines, per cell. Straight lines
 *    are seen at a glance; a line that bends five times has to be found.
 *  - GUESSING (30%): the positions where the solver had to try more than one
 *    way on (`branches`), and then how many positions it looked at (`nodes`).
 *    Where it never branched every step was forced, and all such boards count
 *    as no guessing alike: the positions it looked at then say only how big
 *    the board is, and at 4×4 twelve against thirteen put John's four straight
 *    rows ninth.
 *  - NOT FORCED (25%): the share of the empty cells a person cannot fill by
 *    the one move a line's end has left, repeated until none is left. A board
 *    that fills itself that way is easy whatever else it is.
 *  - LONGEST LINE (10%): the longest line in the answer, in cells. One long
 *    snake is harder to see than several short ones.
 *
 * Each is turned into a percentile among the levels of one size, and the four
 * are blended by those weights into a score from 0 to 100: a level's place
 * among its own size's levels, not a number that means anything across sizes.
 * Measured by itsutsu-19 on the six hundred levels of 2026-09-26 and shown to
 * John before it was used; made here a module the level-making script
 * (`scripts/tsunagi-levels.ts`) orders the levels by. Nothing on the site
 * runs it.
