/**
 * THE TSUNAGI SOLVER: how many ways a layout can be joined, up to a
 * limit, and how much trying it took.
 *
 * Run where the levels are made (`scripts/tsunagi-levels.ts`) and in the
 * unit test that proves every shipped level has exactly one answer — never in
 * a browser and never on a request. A level is a line of data by the time
 * anybody plays it.
 *
 * The rules it counts under are the published ones, and no more: a line runs
 * cell to cell across and down, never through a wall (`steps.ts`), lines never
 * cross or share a cell except on a bridge — where one goes straight across
 * and a different one straight down — a waypoint is taken by its own pair's
 * line and no other, on a board that wraps a line may leave one edge and come
 * back at the other, and every open cell and both ways over every bridge are
 * used. A line MAY run beside itself; the solver counts those
 * answers too, so "exactly one" is a claim about every answer the rules
 * allow, not only the tidy ones.
 *
 * Search: each pair's line grows from its first stone towards its second.
 * At every step the pair with the fewest ways on is grown (a pair with one is
 * forced), after four checks that throw a hopeless grid away early:
 *
 *   - every empty cell still has two ways in and out (an empty cell or an
 *     unfinished line's end beside it), or no line could pass through it;
 *   - every unfinished line's growing end and its far stone each have a way on;
 *   - the growing end and the far stone touch one common region of empty
 *     cells (or each other), or the line can never close;
 *   - every region of empty cells is touched at both ends by some unfinished
 *     line, or nothing could ever fill it.
