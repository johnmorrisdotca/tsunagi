 * before it and "which line is deterministic from the level seed and the
 * moves made", so two players making the same strokes on the same level meet
 * the same explosions, and nothing is left to a coin in the browser.
 *
 * A stroke is a line let go having changed the board (`TsunagiSolve`'s lift).
 * After the `every`-th stroke, and every `every` after it, one line with
 * something drawn is chosen by a hash of the board and the stroke's number:
 *
 *  - `boom<N>`: that line is cut back to half its length.
 *  - `blast<N>`: that line is wiped, and one line touching it is cut back to
 *    half as well.
 *
 * A stroke that solves the level sets nothing off: the level is done first.
 * Pure, like the rest of the drawing rules: new lines, the old ones untouched.
