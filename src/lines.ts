/**
 * THE LINES A PLAYER HAS DRAWN, and what a press and a drag do to them.
 *
 * Pure, and the only place the drawing rules live: the grid reports where a
 * finger went, and this says what the lines are now. Each pair has one line,
 * an ordered list of cells starting at one of its stones; an empty list is no
 * line. Every function returns new lines and leaves the ones it was given
 * alone, the way the engine does.
 *
 *  - Press on a stone: a fresh line starts there, and the pair's old one goes.
 *    A press let go without moving is a tap, and clears the line.
 *  - Press on a line: it is cut back to that cell, and drawing goes on from it.
 *  - Drag into the next cell: the line grows. Back over itself: it shortens,
 *    cell by cell, as the finger goes. Into another pair's line: that line is
 *    cut back to before the cell, and this one goes through. Into another
 *    pair's stone, a blocked cell, across a wall, or past its own far stone:
 *    nothing.
 *  - Onto a bridge: only to go straight on (`steps.ts`); another line already
 *    going the same way over it is cut back, and a line never crosses itself.
 *    A bridge is in a line's list between the cells either side of it, and a
 *    line let go with its tip on a bridge ends before it. Pressing on a bridge
 *    draws nothing: two lines may be there.
