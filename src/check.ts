/**
 * Whether an answer joins a Tsunagi layout: the check a page makes to say
 * "solved" and a server makes before it trusts a solve. O(cells), no search.
 * It does not ask whether the layout is one of the levels: a site that pays
 * or ranks for a solve asks that first (`tsunagiLevelOf`).
 *
 * The answer must carry every stone's letter on its stone, `#` on every
 * blocked cell, `+` on every bridge, a letter on every other cell, and each
 * letter's cells must be one line from one of its stones to the other, stepping
 * as a line may (`steps.ts`: never through a wall, straight over a bridge): the
 * two stones with one step to a cell of their letter each, every cell between
 * with two, all of them joined. A line that ran beside itself would show a cell
 * with three, and is refused; no level's one answer does that, which the level
 * test proves. Each bridge must be crossed straight across by one line and
 * straight down by a different one, and each waypoint passed by its own line.
