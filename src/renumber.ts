/**
 * A RECORD KEPT BY LEVEL NUMBER, MOVED TO THE NUMBERS THE LEVELS HAVE NOW.
 * Tsunagi's levels were renumbered on 2026-09-26 (`renumbered.data.ts`): the
 * same boards, more of them, easiest first. Anything that says "level 10" and
 * was written before then means the board that was level 10, so it is moved
 * to where that board is now — never left on the number, where it would be
 * somebody's time on a different board. A number the old order never had is
 * dropped: it names no board.
 *
 * The server's rows are moved by a migration; this is for what a browser kept
 * of its own (`tsunagiKept.ts`).
